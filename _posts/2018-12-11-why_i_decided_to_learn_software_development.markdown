I decided to learn software development when I was 12. I grew in a small town with no friends nearby so my time after school was spent primarily on the family computer. After enough time playing flash games and surfing web sites, I eventually got curious enough about how to make them myself. I learned enough about HTML and CSS to make some pretty embarrassing fan sites that by the grace of god appear to have fallen off the face of the innerwebs. But that's as far as I ever got, never making anything serious or worth sharing beyond my group of friends. Eventually I got older and started spending more time with friends than learning new skills. Every year I would download a "How to learn Python in 24 hours" book or something similar and give programming a go for a week or two, but never stuck with it. I could never envision how to go from "hello world" to something that would actually be useful.

Software development is something I always thought I would be good with. I'm a natural puzzle solver, I got a perfect score on the math section of my SAT, and I'm absolutely fantastic at googling things and pretending I knew them it the whole time. After a 5-year career in Digital Marketing where I never felt comfortable or could see myself still there in 20 years, I think its time I focused on getting a career I might actually enjoy and excel in. Flatiron School offers me a chance to push myself past where I've always gotten stuck before with a solid support system. It's a chance for a career where I'll have a chance to develop something of meaning and take pride in. A chance to be excited when I go to work in the morning.
